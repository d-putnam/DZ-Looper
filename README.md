DZ-Looper is a macOS desktop app, written in Swift, for quickly creating looping video content from a set of still images.

Users can select a number of images, the duration for each image, and the number of loops.

A second watermark image can also be applied on top of the set of looping source images.

Video is exported as an H.264 .MP4 file at the selected frame size and frame rate.
